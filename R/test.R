#' Generic Function for Hypothesis Testing of Provider Effects
#'
#' `test` is an S3 generic function used to conduct hypothesis tests on provider effect coefficients
#' and detect outlying provider. The function dispatches to the appropriate method
#' based on the class of the input model (`fit`).
#'
#' @param fit the input object, typically a fitted model, for which provider
#' effects are to be tested. The method applied depends on the class of this object.
#' @param ... Additional arguments that can be passed to specific methods.
#'
#' @return the return depends on the method implemented for the
#' class of the input object, typically including statistical outputs for
#' provider effect coefficients and identification of outlier providers.

test <- function(fit, ...) {
  UseMethod("test")
}
