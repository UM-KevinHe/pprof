\title{Data Quality Check including}
\usage{
data_check(Y, Z, ID, message = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{a numerical vector, with values of 0 or 1, indicating the outcome variable.}

\item{Z}{a matrix or data frame containing covariates.}

\item{ID}{a vector representing the provider id. Its elements can be either numeric values or characters.}

\item{message}{a Boolean indicating whether printing out the information of the data preparation process. Defaulting to "TRUE".}

\item{...}{}
}
\value{
\item{data}{a sorted data frame including response, provider identifiers, covariates, and additional provider information.}

\item{char_list}{a list including variable names.}
}
\description{
Data Quality Check including
}
\details{
The function performs the following checks:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Missingness}: Checks for any missing values in the dataset and provides a summary of missing data.
\item \strong{Variation}: Identifies covariates with zero or near-zero variance which might affect model stability.
\item \strong{Correlation}: Analyzes pairwise correlation among covariates and highlights highly correlated pairs.
\item \strong{VIF}: Computes the Variable Inflation Factors to identify covariates with potential multicollinearity issues.
}

The \code{fe_data_prep()} function returns data sorted by the provider identifiers,
accompanied by additional provider-related information indicating whether the provider's size exceeds a specified "cutoff"
and whether the respective provider has experienced either zero or all events.
The reason behind introducing a "cutoff" lies in findings from both simulated and real data studies,
revealing the instability of coefficient estimates for providers with small sizes.
Consequently, we recommend excluding small providers during the model fitting process.
It is important to note that the resultant data frame retains all providers, including small ones,
but utilizes the "included = 0" label to signify the small providers. Subsequently, during the model fitting stage,
the \code{logis_fe()} function disregards records marked with "included = 0".
