}
\details{
The function performs the following checks:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Missingness}: Checks for any missing values in the dataset and provides a summary of missing data.
\item \strong{Variation}: Identifies covariates with zero or near-zero variance which might affect model stability.
\item \strong{Correlation}: Analyzes pairwise correlation among covariates and highlights highly correlated pairs.
\item \strong{VIF}: Computes the Variable Inflation Factors to identify covariates with potential multicollinearity issues.
}

The \code{data_check} function is intended to be private within the \code{ppsrr} package and should not be called directly by users.
Instead, if issues are encountered with the \code{logis_fe} function, users can set \code{check=TRUE} in the \code{logis_fe} function to invoke this function.
