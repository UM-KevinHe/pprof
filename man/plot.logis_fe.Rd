\arguments{
\item{fit}{a model fitted from \code{logis_fe}.}

\item{theme}{theme for the plot. The default is \code{theme_bw()}.}

\item{point_size}{size of the points in the caterpillar plot. The default value is 2.}

\item{point_color}{color of the points in the plot. The default value is "#475569".}

\item{medianline_value}{value of the horizontal median line. The default value is NULL.}

\item{medianline_color}{color of the median line. The default value is "#64748b".}

\item{medianline_size}{size of the median line. The default value is 1.}

\item{medianline_type}{line type for the median line. The default value is "dashed".}

\item{errorbar_width}{the width of the error bars (horizontal ends of the CI bars). The default value is 0.}

\item{errorbar_size}{the thickness of the error bars. The default value is 0.5.}

\item{errorbar_alpha}{transparency level for the error bars. A value between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely transparent and 1 is fully opaque. The default value is 0.5.}

\item{errorbar_color}{color of the error bars. The default value is "#94a3b8".}

\item{use_flag}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, the error bars are colored to show providers' flags based on their performance. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{flag_color}{vector of colors used for flagging providers when \code{use_flag = TRUE}. The default value is \code{c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73")}.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments to pass to the internal \code{confint.linear_fe} function for a \code{linear_fe} object or
the internal \code{confint.linear_re} function for a \code{linear_re} object. These control the type of standardized measure and
confidence intervals to be displayed. The \code{option} argument is fixed to \code{"SM"}, meaning that only standardized measures are supported.}
}
\value{
A list of ggplot objects containing caterpillar plots for indirect and/or direct standardized ratio/rate based on the value of \code{stdz} and \code{measure}.
}
\description{
Provide caterpillar plot for standardized measures from a fixed effect logistic model.
}
\details{
This function creates caterpillar plots to visualize the standardized ratio/rate (indirect or direct) from a fitted fixed effect logistic model.
Each provider's standardized measure value is represented as a point, and a reference line is shown at the value specified by \code{medianline_value} (default is NULL).
If \code{medianline_value} is not specified, for standardized ratios, the reference line will be set at 1;
for standardized rates, the reference line will be set at the population rate, which represents the average outcome across all data points.
The confidence intervals (CI) are displayed as error bars: for \code{alternative = "two.sided"}, the full CI is shown;
for \code{alternative = "greater"}, the error bar extends from the lower bound to the standardized measure value;
and for \code{alternative = "less"}, it extends from the standardized measure value to the upper bound.

When \code{use_flag = TRUE}, the plot will use colors specified by \code{flag_color} to show the flags of providers.
Each error bar will be colored to reflect the flag, making it easy to identify providers with different performance levels.
When \code{use_flag = FALSE}, all error bars will have the same color, specified by \code{errorbar_color}.
This provides a simpler visualization without flagging individual providers.
